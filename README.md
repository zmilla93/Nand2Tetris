# Nand2Tetris
Nand2Tetris is a computer science course by the MIT Press. It takes you through the steps of building a computer starting with nothing more than a simple NAND gate. It then guides you through the process of building an assembler, virtual machine, and compiler for an objected oriented programming language. This repo contain's only my own work and excludes extra course files.

## The Hardware
#### projects/chapters 1-5
The computer is designed using a Hardware Description Language (HDL) and tested using the course's HardwareSimulator tool.

Computer specs
- 16 bit
- 32K RAM
- 512x256 black & white screen
- Keyboard

The course starts by using a NAND gate to build all other logic gates. From there actual computing chips are built like an adder, RAM chip, CPU, and finally a fully functioning computer. The computer can draw text and basic graphics, but notably lacks things like a mouse, hard drive, and file system. If you are curious in the details of the computer hardware, or testing the HDL code yourself, visit the course's website for information and testing tools.
